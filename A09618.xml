            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And with that, we were brought through paternoſter rowe, to my lord of Londons colehowſe. Vnto the which is ioyned a lytle blind howſe, with a great payre of ſtockes, apoynted both
<pb facs="tcp:557:11"/>
for hand and foote. But thankes be to God, we haue not played of thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynes yet, although ſom befor vs had tried them. And ther we founde a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Eſtſex, a maried prieſt, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of godly zeale, with one other pore man. And this miniſter (at my comming) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyred to ſpeake with me, and did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lament hys owne infirmitie for that through extremitie of impriſonment, he was conſtrayned by wryting to yeld to the biſhop of London.

Of the which when my lorde of Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had vnderſtanding, he ſent for hym, and fell vpon hym like a lyon, and like a man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly biſhop buffeted him wel, and plucte awaye a great pece of his beard. But now thankes be to God, he is as Ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vnder the croſſe, as any of vs, and verye ſorye of his former infirmitie. I write thys, becauſe I would all men

becauſe they did teache, and folowe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtraunge doctrine in Europa: &amp; that the chefe churche of the ſame was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Peter and Paule, and had to his tyme continued by faythfull ſucceſſion of the faythfull Biſhops, in preachyng the true Goſpel as they had receyued it of the Apoſtles, and nothyng lyfe to the late ſprong heretikes. &amp;c.

And as touching their ſacrament, whych they terme of the Altar, I ſaye nowe as I ſayd in the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uocacion houſe, that it is not the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, neither in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame is ther any maner of Chriſtes preſence.

               <p>My lorde of London may be ſone anſwered, that the ſayeng of S. Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is that the humanitie of Chriſt which he toke on him for the redemption of man is the bread of lyfe, wherby our bodyes and ſoules be ſuſteyned to eternal lyfe, of the which the ſacramentall bread is a lyuely repreſentacion and an effectuall cohabitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to al ſuche as beleue on his paſſion, and as Chriſt ſayeth in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſyxte of Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I am the bread that came from heauen: but yet he is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial neither natural breade. Lykewyſe the bread is his fleſhe, not natural or ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtanciall, but by ſignification, and by grace in a ſacrament. And nowe to my lorde Ryches argument. I do not deny the expreſſe wordes of Chriſt in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, this is my bodye. But I denye that they are naturally and corporally to be taken, but ſacramentally and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, according to the expreſſe declaraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, ſayeng, that the wordes of the ſacrament, which the Capernaites toke carnally (as the Papiſtes nowe do) ought to be taken ſpiritually, and not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as they falſely ymagine, not way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng what interpretacion Chriſt hathe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:557:53"/>
made in this behalfe. Neither folowe the inſtitution of Chriſt, nether the vſe of the Apoſtles and of the primatiue churche, who neuer taught neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared no ſuch carnal maner of preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as is nowe exacted of vs violently, with out any grounde of ſcripture or antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, who vſed to put out of the church, al ſuche as dyd not receaue the ſacrament with the reſt: &amp; alſo to burne that which was left after the receyuyng, as by the Canon of the Apoſtles, and by the decre of the counſel of Antioche.</p>

I would you could proue it to be the Apoſtolical ſea of that true religion and ſynceritie, as the Apoſtle lefte it, and dyd teache the ſame: The which yf ye can do, you myght boaſt of Rome, as of the Apoſtolical ſea, Otherwyſe it is now

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reherſall of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſucceſſion of the biſhops doth tende to this only, to proue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſtes to be heretykes, becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ganne, aſwel at Rome as in Affrica, to fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de an other churche, then was grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>But his omnipotency will not do as you ſay, contrary to his word and to his honour: it is not Goddes honour to include bodely in a pece of bread, and of neceſſitie to tye him therto.

                  <hi>I</hi> beleue not ſo, for yf it had, Chriſt would haue geuen but the one kinde on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly: for he inſtituted nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſuperfluous and therfore you cannot ſay that the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le effect of the ſacrament is aſwell in one find as in both, ſynce the ſcripture reacheth otherwiſe.</p>

                  <hi>What if I can proue it by ſcripture, that we may miniſter it in one kinde? the Apoſtles dyd ſo, as it may appeare in the Actes of the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les in one or two places, where it is written that the Apoſtles contynued, <hi>in orationibus &amp; fractione panis,</hi> in prayers and in breaking of bread, which is ment of the ſacrament.</hi>

                  <hi>Nay that is not ſo. For I can ſhewe out of Euſebius in Eccleſi. hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoria,

that is of one ſubſtaunce with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but by the determinacion of the church? how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you proue that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by expreſſe wordes of ſcripture, and where fynde you <hi>Homoufios</hi> in all ſcripture?</hi>

               <p>I deny (my lord) that ſucceſſion of biſhops is an infallible point to knowe the churche by: for there may be a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of biſhops knowen in a place, and yet there be no churche, as at Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oche and at Ieruſalem, and in other places, wher the Apoſtles abode aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as at Rome. But if you put to the ſucceſſion of biſhops, ſucceſſion of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine with all (as S.
